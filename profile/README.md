# ProgpJS

ProgpJS is a fast javascript engine for the Go language, using V8 and QuickJS as backend.

ProgpJS is "fast and fast": fast to execute and fast to develop with, thanks to his high performance HTTP server and usage of code generators handling most of the technical stuffs for you.
You write a simple Go function, say under what name it must be exposed to javascript and it's all!
