ProgpJS is a fast javascript engine for the Go language, using V8 as backend.

ProgpJS is "fast and fast": fast to execute and fast to develop with, thanks to a code generator handling
the technical stuffs for you. You write a simple Go function, say under what name it must be exposed to javascript
and it's all!
